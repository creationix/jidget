# Jidget

A super lean library for making web application development a little more like application development and less web development.  This is heavily based on a framework being developed at DocumentCloud, but with a different code style.

## Goals

 - Lean
 - Easy to use
 - Simple
 - Keeps code clean and understandable
 - Bo bloat allowed
 - Hides ugly complexities of HTML as an interface
 - But doesn't hide HTML itself
